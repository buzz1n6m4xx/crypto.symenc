Understanding Symmetric Encryption
**********************************
This program shows an example of symmetric encryption.
You can either generate a key file (randomized mapping list, based on an input file) or use an existing key file to encode/decode strings of previous sessions.
The default input file is based on the standard ASCII (printable characters) table (character code 32-126), and extended by some specific ASCII codes. The full ASCII code table can be reviewed for example at https://www.ascii-code.com/
